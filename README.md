## Getting started
In the root folder of the project, create a `.env` file. In this file, you will need to add your connection string. 

```
CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.abcdef.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase
```

Run a first build, and then start the development environment.

```
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Open your browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and start exploring your new application.

If it is a new cluster then you will have to create the quiz questions first.
